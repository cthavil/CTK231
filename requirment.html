<h3>Sequences in Creative Technologies</h3>

<h4>Accelerated Creative Technologies Sequence</h4>

<p>High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their<br> undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate<br> and graduate program in Creative Technologies. Students can then apply to the Creative Technologies graduate program in the spring of their senior<br> year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Creative Technologies graduate program. For additional<br> information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the Creative<br> Technologies Program advisor.
